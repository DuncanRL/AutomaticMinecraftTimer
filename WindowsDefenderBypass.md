## Why is AutoMCTimer detected as a virus?

My timer is programmed in python, and to package this into a ".exe", I use a software called "pyinstaller". Unfortunately, many virus makers use pyinstaller, causing most (if not all) software developed using it to be flagged as a virus.

This software is fully open source, and the only thing that could be percieved as remotely malicious in the timer is the automatic checking of this github to see if there are any updates.

## How to get past the virus detection

This is a tutorial to get past the "virus detected" crap that happens when you download my timer.

#### It is important that you complete every step as to not put your computer at risk of real viruses.

### STEP 1

Open the virus and threat exclusions settings. This can be done by opening virus and threat protection (press your windows key and search for it). Then go to "manage settings" and then "Add or remove exclusions"

### STEP 2

Click "Add an exclusion" and then "File Type", and enter "exe".

### STEP 3

### Step 4

#### This is an important step, the previous steps put your computer in a more vunerable state, this step is to undo that at the same time as keeping the timer

Add another exclusion for "file", and then select the timer you just downloaded.

Once done, remove the exe file type exclusion.

With this completed, you should have the timer downloaded, and your computer should be just as safe as before downloading the timer.
