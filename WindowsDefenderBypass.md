## Why is AutoMCTimer detected as a virus?

My timer is built on python, and to package this into a ".exe", I use a software called "pyinstaller". Unfortunately, many virus makers use pyinstaller, causing most (if not all) software developed using it to be flagged as a virus.

This software is fully open source, and the only thing that could be percieved as remotely malicious in the timer is the automatic checking of this github to see if there are any updates.

## How to get past the virus detection

This is a tutorial to get past the "virus detected" crap that happens when you download my timer.

### STEP 1

Open virus and threat protection. This can be done by pressing your windows key and searching for it:
